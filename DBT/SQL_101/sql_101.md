## Why SQL when you have pandas or all those better libraries?
    Pandas, CSV files, Apache Parquet and other data processing 
    tools are powerful and suitable for many tasks, they offer
    expressiveness but not the same robustness as SQL. (old but industry standard).

    Advantages of SQl include: robustness and concurrency of querying 
    from different users. Really read and write operations

## Basic SQL Syntax
    * SELECT Statement: select a given table from a talbe
      SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name:
    
    * WHERE CLAUSE: usually like if (condition)
      used to filter records given a specified condition.
      SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition:

    * JOIN CLAUSE: select columns from different tables
      and join them into a new table.
      
      SELECT column1, column2 FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 on
      table1.column=table2.column;
      
      Lets consider the 2 tables:
      users table:

        user_id	username	email
        1	    Alice	    alice@example.com
        2	    Bob	        bob@example.com
        3   	Charlie	    charlie@example.com

        orders table:
        order_id	user_id	product
        1	        1	    Product_A
        2	        2	    Product_B
        3	        1	    Product_C
        4	        3	    Product_D
       
       Table 2 Example Use case:
